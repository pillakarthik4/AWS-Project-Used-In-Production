how to create a VPC that you can use for servers in a production environment. To improve resiliency, you deploy the servers in two Availability Zones, by using an Auto Scaling group and an Application Load Balancer. For additional security, you deploy the servers in private subnets. The servers receive requests through the load balancer. The servers can connect to the internet by using a NAT gateway. To improve resiliency, you deploy the NAT gateway in both Availability Zones.

OVERVIEW****
=========
The VPC has two private and public subnets with two Availability Zones.
Each Public subnet contains NAT gateway and Load Balancer Nodes.
The servers run in private subnets, are Launched and terminated by using an Auto Scaling group, and receive traffic from Load Balancer.
The server can connect to the internet by using NAT gateway .

**Created Autoscaling group with Launch template with 2 private subnets.  2 Instances are created in EC2.
And created Boston-Host to instance to communicate with 2 instances created by Autoscaling group.**

//**Created Loadbalancer with target group for private subnet instance to communicate with internet.
Load Balancer placed iN public Subnets.**//


In the terminal copied the Pem.file to the local to the remote machine of the Boston host instance using the commands below :
